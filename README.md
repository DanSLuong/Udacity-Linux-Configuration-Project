2. Under the firewall section, add Custom TCP 2200 and Custom UDP 123 and hit save.

### Update all currently installed packages.
1. sudo apt-get update
2. sudo apt-get upgrade
3. sudo apt-get autoremove to remove unused packages
4. sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades to enable autougrades
5. sudo apt-get install finger just like in the udacity lessons to check when the grader user is created

### Change the SSH port from 22 to 2200
1. sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2. Change the port from 22 to 2200
3. ctrl+o & ctrl+x to save and exit
